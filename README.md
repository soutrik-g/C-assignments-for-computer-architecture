This repo lists any significant work any creative/significasnt task I have created using the C language.
- two-d-arr.c contains the code I wrote to emulate a two dimensional byte array using a one dimensional character buffer. Included in the code are operations to treat the 2D byte array as a proxy for a memory array.
- buffer.c shows the functionality of an "input" and an "output" buffer using buffer arrays of any arbitrary value to enable transfer of data while reducing sys calls.
